#DerbyBetting

This is a simple betting web application for betting on the Kentucky Derby or any other race that is shown on the Churchill Downs toteboard.

## About

This was done as a simple web application experiement to see if it was possible to build a web application that didn't need the support of local/custom web serve. It is build using jQuery, Spine, and YQL. The site uses local storage to maintain data.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) installed, then run 'jekyll build' in the base directory. Next run the site and follow the on screen directions. Only races that are in the future will successfully work for betting (past races only have a summary of information available), but the rest of the application can be accessed/modified at anytime.
